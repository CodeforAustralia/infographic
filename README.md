# DELWP Infographic

The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, know as DELWP, is the result of merging to former departments in government. It manages different areas around Victoria, however, the community is still unclear of what the deparment does.

This project is design to better communicate DELWP's defined role in the Victorian government and the different groups under the DELWP umbrella. The infographic is an interactive illustration of how the department functions into a single department to strengthen connections between the environment, community, industry and economy.
